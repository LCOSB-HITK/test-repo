## how to use this template
- during creation of new repository, select this repo from the "Repository template" dropdown. 
- change the names of the folders *inside* the COMPONENTS folder according to your choice and maintain that name to identify your sub-module component.
- keep a good documentation in all the *.md files in the repo
- DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE GitHub::submodule [helper-sw](https://github.com/LCOSB-HITK/helper-sw) inside the repo

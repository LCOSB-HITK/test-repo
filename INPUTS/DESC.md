# DESCRIPTION of input data 
For all the input data files that are in this folder, should have some description of the data and possible associations/use in the code (mention which component/scripts).

Try to keep it organised so that others can easily understand

also, if your INPUTS folder is more than 10MB in size, try creating a download script in the INPUTS folder and mention here in DESC.md - (filename, download-link, purpose, scripts-that-can-download) (for eg. you can download data from google drive)
